## Posting resources to issue
The simplest way to add a resource is to post it to [this issue](https://github.com/A-make/awesome-control-theory/issues/1). Please add name, link, type (e.g. book, video lecture etc.) and a short description of the resource(s).  

## Pull-request

For larger edits you can create a pull-request. Ensure your request adheres to the following guidelines:

- If you submit a resource that is similar to an existing one in the list, argue how it's better.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the package and why it should be included.
- Use the following format: `[package](link) - Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.
- Check your spelling and grammar.

Thank you for your suggestion!

### Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
